SlipStream is a stream of consciousness note taking app where you can view your notes in different ways.

## Background - the context or problems that led to the development of the project

This app was built to best suit how I take notes, especially for work. I prefer to bound a piece of information by the dated it was conceived, so that I can see how my information comes together cronologicly (like a diary), but find when I need to reference a piece of information Ive noted down, I need to rely on how my notes are organised to find them but also benefit from having notes of the same concern visibly together in one place. Not many apps Ive found do this, with existing apps I usually find myself having to manually find an existing note to add a piece of information to - but because all my information is just one piece of text that makes up that note, you loose that date metadata on a per information basis, and makes the date of the entire note less meaningful. not to mention the extra effort you have to put into to worrying about formatting, page hierarchy, etc.

anything from company news updates to information about a feature im working on.
