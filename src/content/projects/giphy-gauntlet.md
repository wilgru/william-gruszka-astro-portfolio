Giphy Gauntlet is an app that I built a long time ago when I was learning the fundamentals of web development, built using pure HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

The site has a couple bugs and the code itself isnâ€™t the prettiest, but from a users perspective its still a very playable game with cool features, animations and a unique style which together gives this little web game a leg to stand on.
